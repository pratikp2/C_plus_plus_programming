New Language Feature :
-- variable templates
-- generic lambdas
-- lambda init-capture
-- new/delete elision
-- relaxed restrictions on constexpr functions
-- binary literals
-- digit separators
-- return type deduction for functions
-- aggregate classes with default non-static member initializers.

New library features
-- std::make_unique
-- std::shared_timed_mutex and std::shared_lock
-- std::integer_sequence
-- std::exchange
-- std::quoted
        and many small improvements to existing library facilities, such as
        two-range overloads for some algorithms
        type alias versions of type traits
        user-defined literals for basic_string, duration and complex
        etc.




1. Binary Literals: Writing binary numbers directly using 0b or 0B prefix.
2. Generic Lambdas: Lambdas with auto parameters.
3. Return Type Deduction: Automatically deducing return types for functions.
4. Relaxed constexpr: Allowing more complex operations in constexpr functions.
5. Variable Templates: Templates for variables.
6. declaration of auto function return types: Allowing auto in function return types for template functions.
7. Aggregate Member Initialization: More flexible initialization of aggregate classes.
8. Extended constexpr: Even more relaxed constraints on constexpr functions.
