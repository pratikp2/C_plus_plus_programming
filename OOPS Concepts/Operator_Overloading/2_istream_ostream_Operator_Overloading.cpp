 /***********************************************    Key Points    *******************************************************

1) cout is an object of ostream class and cin is an object istream class
2) These operators must be overloaded as a global function. And if we want to allow them to access private data members 
   of class, we must make them friend.
3) &in and &out are objects of the istream and ostream class respectively.(Exactly similar to cin and cout.)
4) The operators â€˜<<' and '>>' are called like 'cout << ob1' and 'cin >> ob1'. So if we want to make them a member method,
   then they must be made members of ostream and istream classes, which is not a good option most of the time. Therefore,
   these operators are overloaded as global functions with two parameters, cout and object of user defined class.
