Capgemini ##s :
	-- Abstraction , Encapsulation , Runtime Polymorphism , Inheritance
	-- access specifier , purpose of each access specifiers. calling function from base class from derive pointer (with access  		   specifier)
	-- Virtual , virtual function without def., pure virtual without def., object of abstract class
	-- diff for malloc and new.
	-- default things provided by compiler.
	-- diff for = operator overloading and copy constructor
	-- Posix thread , Reason of passing void * in pthread create, Mutual exclusion , Mutex ,
	-- Build type : Release build and Debug Build Concepts.
	-- this pointer, deleting this pointer , Calling a function via this pointer after deletion of this pointer.
	-- Singleton Pattern. why to make static method in singleton.

	A copy constructor is used to initialize a previously uninitialized object from some other object's data.
	An assignment operator is used to replace the data of a previously initialized object with some other object's data.


Pratiti ##s :
	-- Write code which converts multiple digit alphanumeric into numeric value.
	-- Write code for assignment operator overloading.

Robert Bosch ##s :
	-- Code output recursive main call ,Code output for "for loop"
	-- code to find out Even no without using conditional operator
	-- What is the value stored by the compiler for NULL pointer.
	-- difference between 0 , NULL , '\0'
	-- can we declare a class within class.
	-- 4 stages of compilation
	-- fpic in linux, shared libraries
	-- git reset hard, git remote push, git rebase,git amend
	-- virtual concept vtable and vptr.
	-- runtime polymorphism and inheritance in detail, usefulness of inheritance
	-- diff between abstract class and interface

	-- Inheritance defination, types , concepts, hararchy inheritance ##s 
	-- when to call a destructor, how to call a destructor, is is possible to call in main.
	-- Runtime polymorphism (Explain with example)
	-- Difference new and malloc 
	-- Difference between free and delete.
	-- when to use delete,free,malloc,calloc,new.
	-- Write a code to detect weather given series is fibobacci or not.
	-- Difference between array and link list (time and memory complexity)
	-- Geomerty : - How many circles can be drawn through three non collinear or collinear points.
				  - How to calculate the weather a point lies inside or outside of a circle.
				  - How to calculate the distance between two points.
	-- Puzzles	: - Three boxes one contains red balls ,one contains blue and one contains both,labels are not correct.
				  - 12 socks 6 black and 6 black mixed all togehter in dark room.
