* The pthread_detach() function marks the thread identified by thread as detached. When a detached thread
* terminates, its resources are automatically released back to the system without the need for another
* thread to join with the terminated thread. Due to this there is no way to determine its return value
* of detached thread function. pthread_detach() will return non zero value in case of error.
*
*   int pthread_attr_init(pthread_attr_t *attr);
*       The function pthread_attr_init() is used to initialize object attributes to their default values.
*       The storage is allocated by the thread system during execution.
*

//  Output can change on your system because both main and thread function are running in parallel.
//  If main function exits then all other threads will be exited. Hence If main process exits 1st,
//  output for child thread will not shown.
//
// Why to Detach Thread:
//  pthread_join does two things:
//
//  1.Wait for the thread to finish.
//  2.Clean up any resources associated with the thread.
//
//  If you exit the process without joining, then (2) will be done for you by the OS (although it won't
//  do thread cancellation cleanup, just nuke the thread from orbit), and (1) will not. So whether you
//  need to call pthread_join depends whether you need (1) to happen.
//
//  If you don't need the thread to run, then as everyone else is saying you may as well detach it.
//  A detached thread cannot be joined (so you can't wait on its completion), but its resources are
//  freed automatically if it does complete.
