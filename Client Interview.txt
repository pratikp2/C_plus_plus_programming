Memory Leaks : 
A failure in a program to release discarded memory, causing impaired performance or failure.

-- To avoid memory leaks, memory allocated on heap should always be freed when no longer needed.
-- Instead of managing memory manually, try to use smart pointers where applicable.
-- Use std::string instead of char *. The std::string class handles all memory management internally, and it’s fast and well-optimized.
-- Never use a raw pointer unless it’s to interface with an older lib.
-- The best way to avoid memory leaks in C++ is to have as few new/delete calls at the program level as possible – ideally NONE. Anything that equires dynamic memory should be buried inside an RAII object that releases the memory when it goes out of scope. RAAI allocate memory in constructor and release it in destructor, so that memory is garanteed to be deallocated when the variable leave the current scope.
-- Allocate memory by new keyword and deallocate memory by delete keyword and write all code between them.


RAII : Resource allocation is Initiliazation.

-- RAII stands for "Resource Acquisition is Initialisation." The "resource acquisition" part of RAII is where you begin something that must be ended later, such as:
		Opening a file (and closing it later)
		Allocating some memory (and deallocating it later)
		Acquiring a lock (and releasing it later)

-- The C++ library classes that manage their own resources follow RAII: std::string, std::vector, std::thread, and many others acquire their resources in constructors 		(which throw exceptions on errors), release them in their destructors (which never throw), and don't require 	explicit cleanup. 
-- In addition, the standard library offers several RAII wrappers to manage user-provided resources: 
   	std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr to manage dynamically-allocated memory or, with a user-provided deleter, any resource represented by a plain pointer; 
-- std::lock_guard, std::unique_lock, std::shared_lock to manage mutexes.
