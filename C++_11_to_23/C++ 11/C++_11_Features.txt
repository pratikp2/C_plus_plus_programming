Features Added in C++ 11 :

01. Auto Keyword: Type inference for variables.
02. Range-Based For Loop: Simplified iteration over containers.
03. Lambda Expressions: Anonymous functions for more concise and functional code.
04. nullptr: A type-safe null pointer.
05. Static Assertions: Compile-time assertions with static_assert.
06. Move Semantics and Rvalue References: Optimized resource management with &&.
07. Smart Pointers: std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, and std::weak_ptr.
08. Type Aliases: Using using as an alternative to typedef.
09. Uniform Initialization Syntax: Brace-initialization for all types.
10. Delegating Constructors: Calling one constructor from another in the same class.
11. Default and Deleted Functions: Explicitly default or delete special member functions.
12. Variadic Templates: Template programming with a variable number of arguments.
13. constexpr: Compile-time constant expressions.
14. Standard Thread Library: Multithreading support with std::thread and related constructs.
15. Extended constexpr: Enabling more complex constant expressions.
16. Override and Final: Explicitly specifying overrides and preventing further derivations.
17. User-Defined Literals: Custom literal suffixes.
18. Enum Classes: Strongly typed and scoped enums.
29. nullptr: A new keyword replacing NULL.
